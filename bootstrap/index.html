                        <p>Another Olympian making their Olympic debut is 21 year old tennis star Coco Gauff.

                        <p>Ledecky is the most dominant female swimmer we've seen in a generation, and perhaps in history. She has a legitimate shot to finish these games as the most decorated Olympic swimmer in history. She already has six individual gold medals to her name and is the world record holder in the 800 and 1500 meter races. She made her Olympic debut at London in 2012 and won the gold medal there, and has not slowed down since.</p>

                        <p>This American soccer legend is likely making her final appearance at the Olympics donning the Red, White, and Blue. Morgan has been a staple for the USWNT since 2011, when she became the youngest player in history to make an appearance for the Women's National Team. She made her Olympic debut in 2021, where she scored the winning goal of the gold medal match against Canada in extra time to solidify herself as a world-class player.</p>

                        <p>No Olympic preview list would be complete without the legend that is Simone Biles. The 27 year old is the most decorated gymnast in history and holds 37 Olympic and World Championship medals. In 2016, Biles won gold in floor, vault, all-around, and team events - all of which came in her Olympic debut.Her 2020 Olympic appearance was marred by controversy after a decision to withdrawl due to mental blocks, but the greatest gymnast of all time looks to make her return in Paris and prove her doubters wrong.</p>
