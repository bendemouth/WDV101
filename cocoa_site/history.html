            <h2>The Domestication of Cocoa</h2>
                <p>Cocoa was first domesticated over <strong>5,000 years ago</strong> in what is modern-day Ecuador. Archaeological sites indicate that the Mayo-Chinchipe culture first domesticated the plant.</p>
            
                <p>These people were not using cocoa the way that you and I use it today, however. Before techniques to process the sweet pulp of the plant were developed, it appears that the Mayo-Chinchipe used the plant to make an alcoholic beverage! Now, I've heard of Mudslides but these people were ahead of the game!</p>
            
                <h3>Cocoa in Mesoamerica</h3>
                    <p>From the Mayo-Chinchipe civilization, the plant then spread throughout Central and South America. The Olmecs, who were the first major civilization in Mesoamerica, appear to hae used the plan in spiritual ceremonies as far back as 4,000 years ago.</p>
            
                    <p>One soldier from the conquistador army of Hernan Cortez gives us an interesting look at how Cocoa was used prior to the destuction of the Azten Empire. He claims that Emperor Moctezuma II drank no other beverage than chocolate served in a golden goblet and flavored with vanilla and other spices. It is written that Moctezuma II would consume <em>60 portions</em> of this drink every day, and more than <em>2,000 portions</em> were distributed among his courtiers. Bernal Diaz, the soldier who made these observations once wrote in his journal: </p>
            
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>From time to time, they served him [Montezuma] in cups of pure gold a certain drink made from cacao. It was said that it gave one power over women, but this I never saw. I did see them bring in more than fifty large pitchers of cacao with froth in it, and he drank some of it, the women serving with great reverence.</p>
                    </blockquote>
            
            
            <h2>The Spread of Cocoa</h2>
                <h3>Cocoa in Europe</h3>
                    <p>Following the colonization of the Carribbean by Columbus and the Aztec Conquest by Hernan Cortez, the two brough Cocoa back to Europe for the first time. Prior to Columbus and Cortez, the cocoa plant was entirely unknown to Europeans.</p>
            
                    <p>Europeans, however, did not intially use the plant in the way Mesoamericans did. On subsequent trips to Mexico and Central America, the Spanish studied the medicinal aspects of Cocoa, specifically being interested in its uses as an aphrodisiac. Regarding Diaz's journal entry, King Phillip II wanted to produce similar results of "power of women."</p>
                
                <h3>Expansion of Production and the Triangular Trade</h3>
                    <p>As Europeans developed a taste for chocolate, the demand for the cocoa plant skyrocketed. Initially, chocolate was a luxury reserved for the aristocrats, but with the development of the steam engine in the 18th Century, the delicacy became more widely available. In much the same way that the cotton gin led to an explosion in slavery in the United States to produce more cotton, so did the steam engine lead to an explosion in European slavery to produce more cocoa.</p>
            
                    <p>This, then, brought the cocoa plant to Africa. As Europeans colonized the African continent, they brought the cocoa plant from their American colonies to their African colonies. To this day, the vast majority of the world's cocoa is grown in Africa in areas that are former European colonies.</p>
