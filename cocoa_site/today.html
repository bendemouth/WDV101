            <h2>How is cocoa used today?</h2>
                <h3>Snacks!</h3>
                    <p>The most common use of the cocoa plant today is as a delicious snack. There are multiple chocolate companies today that are worth well over $1 billion. The top five are: </p>

                        <li>Hershey - $8.2bn</li>

                <h3>Workout Recovery</h3>
                    <p>Chocolate doesn't have to be just a guitly pleasure snack. Many of the world's best athletes use chocolate milk to help them with workout recovery!</p>

                    <p>Chocolate milk is a good source of carbohydrates, protein, and vitamins to help the body recover after a difficult workout. The milk also helps the body to build healthier and stronger bones. Chocolate milk is ultimately a simple drink that gives athletes many of the nutrients that they need to recover!</p>

            <h2>Chocolate Production</h2>
                    <h3 id="regions">Regions</h3>
                        <p>More than two-thirds of the world's cocoa is produced in West Africa, with much of that coming in the Ivory Coast. 38% of the world's cocoa comes from the Ivory Coast.</p>

                        <p>Indonesia is also a large producer of cocoa and are the only non-African country in the top-five.</p>

                        <p>Ironically, there are no countries in the Americas that are in the top-five for cocoa production, despite that being the region of the world to where the plant is native.</p>

                    <h3>Sustainability Issues</h3>
                        <p>There are many sustainability issues with modern production of the cocoa plant. Despite having all kinds of industrial methods available to aid in the production of the crop, most cocoa production is done using unpaid or child labor.</p>

                        <p>Cocoa production also has a massive impact on the environment. Cocoa <em>can</em> be grown in the shade, but the plant is more productive in the sun. To that end, many producers of cocoa clear large patches of the world's rainforest to maximize cocoa production. Because of this, the Ivory Coast has lost over <strong>80% of their natural rainforests in the last 50 years.</strong></p>

                        <p>Production of cocoa takes huge amounts of water as well. One chocolate bar can take around 450 gallons of water to produce.</p>

                        <p>All this doesn't account for the other ingredients that go in to producing a chocolate bar either. Considering what it takes to make sugar, dairy products, and soy, the environmental impact of chocolate is truly astounding.</p>
