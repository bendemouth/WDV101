    <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>My name is Ben DeMouth and I am currently a student at Des Moines Area Community College. I am working on an AS degree in Computer Languages with certifications in Data Science and Python Application Development. I graduated from the University of Northern Iowa in 2021 with a BA in Sports Public Relations, but have recently began going back to school to enhance my professional skills after funding was cut for a fiber optic project that I was working on.</p>

        <p>In addition to the fiber optic experience, I also have a decade of experience in the transportation and logistics industry. I began work in that industry working on the factor lines and eventually worked my way up to being the lead account manager for the factoring division of the company.</p>

        <p>During my time at UNI, I spent two years working at Radio on the Go, a radio station that broadcast two channels (KLMJ and KQCR) servicing north-central Iowa. I hosted the stations' flagship Friday night program live from 10pm to midnight covering local high school sports. My responsibilities also included writing stories for broadcast and for web publication, as well as working the board for live events.</p>

        <p>My most recent project, Best Fit Sports Data, is a dream project of mine that I am working to build while I am in school. This project has taught me so much about how the sports industry works, in addition to all of the technical skills. Most of my project is done in RStudio, but I have also done a lot of work in Python through the development of GUI applications.</p>
