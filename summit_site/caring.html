        <h2>Personality Profile</h2>
            <p>Huskies are high energy and extremely intelligent dogs, and are often describes as adventurous. For much of the history of the breed, huskies have been used as working dogs, typically pulling sleds to help humans navigate harsh winter conditions.</p>
        
            <p>This high energy is fun for many owners, but ensuring that the dog is properly stimulated and gets plenty of exercise is vital to ensure the happiness and health of your pet. When huskies do not get the right amount of exercise and stimulation, that energy can become destructive.</p>
        
            <p>The intelligence of the breed is a double-edged sword as well. On the one hand, huskies are very smart and can be trained to do many things and to help with different tasks. On the other hand, they can be difficult to train if not given the proper training regiment. Their strong personalities can make it challenging to train them, but with enough time, love, and care, huskies can be a wonderful companion.</p>
        
        <h2>Caring for Husky Coats</h2>
            <p>Huskies have what is called a double coat, which can be difficult to care for if you do not understand it. The top coat is made of thicker hair that provide protection for the undercoat and for the skit itself. The under coat is made of softer hair that traps air and keeps huskies warm.</p>
        
            <p>Because of the double coat, huskies tend to shed a lot more than other breeds, particularly in the summer months.</p>
        
            <p>It is important to remember that huskies should <strong>never</strong> be shaved, except in the case of emergency.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <p>When feeding your husky, it is important to remember what the breed has done for most of its history. They have been bred to run long distances on minimal food.</p>
        
            <p>To that end, it is important to remember not to overfeed your dog. Huskies will certainly eat as much as you give them, but they will be happiest and healthiest on smaller amounts of high quality food.</p>
